# 📖 Kwai Hidemi - OS Structure & Principles

It is a repository that organizes various codes obtained by reading and learning Kwai Hidemi's book, OS 구조와 원리; OS 개발 30일 프로젝트 (Original Edition: OS自作入門; 30日でできる！)

The results of learning and practicing from the book are recorded in my [Velog](https://velog.io/@dohan_/series/Books).
